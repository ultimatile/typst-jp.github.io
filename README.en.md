# Typst Japanese Documentation (Unofficial)

> [!NOTE]
> 日本語版は[README.md](README.md)を参照してください。

This is an unofficial Japanese translation of the documentation for the typesetting system [Typst](https://typst.app/docs). It has been created with the permission of [Typst GmbH](https://typst.app/legal/).

The repository was forked from the [Chinese version](https://github.com/typst-doc-cn/typst-doc-cn.github.io) and is translated into Japanese based on the official documentation of [Typst v0.13.1](https://typst.app/docs/changelog/#v0.13.1) as of October 2024.

The actual working web version can be viewed at the following URL.
